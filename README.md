```error: (-215:Assertion failed)```
 ## This error could be 
 1. opencv cannot find a media file at the particular location that you specified 
2. the video ran out of frames opencv could not find any more frames after the last frame in this video so it unexpectedly broke out of the while loop by itself by raising cv to error
